The following code snippet demonstrates a common issue when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener in conjunction with asynchronous operations:

```javascript
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(async user => {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in, load user data
    const userData = await loadUserData(user.uid);
    console.log('User data:', userData);
  } else {
    // No user is signed in.
    console.log('User is not signed in.');
  }
});

async function loadUserData(uid) {
  // Simulate an asynchronous operation to fetch user data
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  // Return some user data
  return { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' };
}
```

The problem arises because `onAuthStateChanged` might trigger multiple times rapidly, leading to concurrent calls to `loadUserData`.  If `loadUserData` involves network requests or other potentially long-running operations, this can result in excessive and unnecessary data fetching, performance degradation, and possible race conditions, particularly if multiple authentication events trigger within a small time frame.  The UI will reflect the last value of `userData`, possibly making it look like everything works fine despite the extra, wasted requests.
