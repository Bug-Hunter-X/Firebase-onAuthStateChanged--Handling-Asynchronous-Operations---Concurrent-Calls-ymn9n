# Firebase onAuthStateChanged: Concurrent Calls & Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener with asynchronous operations that fetch data.  The problem lies in handling multiple calls to the data loading function due to rapid authentication events. This can lead to performance problems and potential race conditions.

## Problem

The `onAuthStateChanged` listener might trigger multiple times in quick succession, leading to multiple concurrent calls to an asynchronous function like `loadUserData`. If this function involves network requests or other potentially slow operations, it can result in unnecessary resource consumption and potentially inconsistent UI updates. The code in `bug.js` showcases this issue.

## Solution

The solution (`bugSolution.js`) addresses this by using a combination of a boolean flag to track the loading state and `Promise.resolve()` to handle the possibility of multiple authentication events in quick succession. This approach prevents concurrent calls and ensures efficient resource usage.  See the explanation in the `bugSolution.js` file for further details.
